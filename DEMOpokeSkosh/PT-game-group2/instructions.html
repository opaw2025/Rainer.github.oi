      <h2>How to Play Pokémon Adventure</h2>
      <p>
        In this Pokémon Adventure, you'll step into the shoes of a Pokémon Trainer on an exciting journey to become a Pokémon Master. Here are the instructions to get started.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        First, choose your trainer — a determined boy or a courageous girl. Then, give your trainer a name that suits your personality. This name will be used throughout your adventure.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Once you begin, select the difficulty level that best fits your playstyle. Higher difficulties mean stronger opponents and more strategic battles. Choose wisely based on your experience.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Next, you’ll select three Pokémon from a set of twelve. Each Pokémon has unique strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. Choose carefully and build a balanced team that can handle any challenge.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Battles follow a turn-based system where you and your opponent take turns attacking. Understanding type advantages and planning your moves are key to success. When one of your Pokémon faints, another from your team will step in to continue the fight.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Throughout your journey, you’ll face rival trainers and gym leaders, including well-known figures such as Brock, Misty, and Lt. Surge. Defeat them to earn recognition and climb your way to becoming the ultimate Pokémon Master.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Your ultimate goal is to overcome all four trainers, prove your strength, and achieve mastery as a Pokémon Champion. Once you’ve completed your journey, you can start a new one, try different Pokémon teams, or replay at a higher difficulty.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Good luck, Trainer. Your Pokémon journey begins now!
